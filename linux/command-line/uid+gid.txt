In Unix, how do I find a user's UID or GID?
To find a user's UID or GID in Unix, use the id command. To find a specific user's UID, at the 
Unix prompt, enter:

  id -u username
Replace username with the appropriate user's username. To find a user's GID, at the Unix prompt, 
enter:

  id -g username
If you wish to find out all the groups a user belongs to, instead enter:

  id -G username
If you wish to see the UID and all groups associated with a user, enter id without any options, 
as follows:

  id username
