<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>ps [options]</H2><PRE>




</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>ps displays information about a selection of the active processes. If you want</H2><PRE>
a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information, use <B>top(1)</B>
instead.


</PRE>
<H2>This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:</H2><PRE>
1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceeded by a dash.
2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
3   GNU long options, which are preceeded by two dashes.

Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.
There are some synonomous options, which are functionally identical, due to

</PRE>
<H2>the many standards and ps implementations that this ps is compatible with.</H2><PRE>


</PRE>
<H2>Note that "ps -aux" is distinct from "ps aux". The POSIX and UNIX standards</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>require that "ps -aux" print all processes owned by a user named "x", as well</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>as printing all processes that would be selected by the -a option. If the user</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>named "x" does not exist, this ps may interpret the command as "ps aux"</H2><PRE>
instead and print a warning. This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning
old scripts and habits. It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not
be relied upon.


</PRE>
<H2>By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user ID (EUID) as</H2><PRE>
the curent user and associated with the same terminal as the invoker. It
displays the process ID (PID), the terminal associated with the process (TTY),
the cumulated CPU time in [dd-]hh:mm:ss format (TIME), and the executable name
(CMD). Output is unsorted by default.

The use of BSD-style options will add process state (STAT) to the default
display and show the command args (COMMAND) instead of the executable name.

</PRE>
<H2>You can override this with the PS_FORMAT environment variable. The use of</H2><PRE>
BSD-style options will also change the process selection to include processes
on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be
described as setting the selection to be the set of all processes filtered to
exclude processes owned by other users or not on a terminal. These effects are

</PRE>
<H2>not considered when options are described as being "identical" below, so -M</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>will be considered identical to Z and so on.</H2><PRE>

Except as described below, process selection options are additive. The default
selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added to the set
of processes to be displayed. A process will thus be shown if it meets any of
the given selection criteria.



</PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>SIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>-A              Select all processes. Identical to -e.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-N              Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified</H2><PRE>
                conditions. (negates the selection) Identical to <B>--deselect</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>T               Select all processes associated with this terminal. Identical</H2><PRE>
                to the <B>t</B> option without any argument.



</PRE>
<H2>-a              Select all processes except session leaders (see getsid(2))</H2><PRE>
                and processes not associated with a terminal.



</PRE>
<H2>a               Lift the BSD-style "only yourself" restriction, which is</H2><PRE>
                imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
                (without "-") options are used or when the <B>ps</B> personality
                setting is BSD-like. The set of processes selected in this
                manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by
                other means. An alternate description is that this option
                causes <B>ps</B> to list all processes with a terminal (tty), or to
                list all processes when used together with the <B>x</B> option.



</PRE>
<H2>-d              Select all processes except session leaders.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-e              Select all processes. Identical to -A.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>g               Really all, even session leaders. This flag is obsolete and</H2><PRE>
                may be discontinued in a future release. It is normally
                implied by the <B>a</B> flag, and is only useful when operating in
                the sunos4 personality.



</PRE>
<H2>r               Restrict the selection to only running processes.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>x               Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is</H2><PRE>
                imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
                (without "-") options are used or when the <B>ps</B> personality
                setting is BSD-like. The set of processes selected in this
                manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by
                other means. An alternate description is that this option
                causes <B>ps</B> to list all processes owned by you (same EUID as
                <B>ps</B>), or to list all processes when used together with the <B>a</B>
                option.



</PRE>
<H2>--deselect      Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified</H2><PRE>
                conditions. (negates the selection) Identical to <B>-N</B>.




</PRE>
<H2>PROCESS SELECTION BY LIST</H2><PRE>
These options accept a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or
comma-separated list. They can be used multiple times.

</PRE>
<H2>For example: ps -p "1 2" -p 3,4</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-C cmdlist      Select by command name.</H2><PRE>
                This selects the processes whose executable name is given in
                <I>cmdlist</I>.



</PRE>
<H2>-G grplist      Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.</H2><PRE>
                This selects the processes whose real group name or ID is in
                the <I>grplist</I> list. The real group ID identifies the group of
                the user who created the process, see <B>getgid(2)</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>U userlist      Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.</H2><PRE>
                This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is
                in <I>userlist</I>. The effective user ID describes the user whose
                file access permissions are used by the process
                (see <B>geteuid(2)</B>). Identical to <B>-u</B> and <B>--user</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>-U userlist     select by real user ID (RUID) or name.</H2><PRE>
                It selects the processes whose real user name or ID is in the
                <I>userlist</I> list. The real user ID identifies the user who
                created the process, see <B>getuid(2)</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>-g grplist      Select by session OR by effective group name.</H2><PRE>
                Selection by session is specified by many standards, but
                selection by effective group is the logical behavior that
                several other operating systems use. This <B>ps</B> will select by
                session when the list is completely numeric (as sessions are).
                Group ID numbers will work only when some group names are also
                specified. See the <B>-s</B> and <B>--group</B> options.



</PRE>
<H2>p pidlist       Select by process ID. Identical to -p and --pid.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-p pidlist      Select by PID.</H2><PRE>
                This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in
                <I>pidlist</I>. Identical to <B>p</B> and <B>--pid</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>-s sesslist     Select by session ID.</H2><PRE>
                This selects the processes with a session ID specified
                in <I>sesslist</I>.



</PRE>
<H2>t ttylist       Select by tty. Nearly identical to -t and --tty, but can also</H2><PRE>
                be used with an empty <I>ttylist</I> to indicate the terminal
                associated with <B>ps</B>. Using the <B>T</B> option is considered cleaner
                than using <B>T</B> with an empty <I>ttylist</I>.



</PRE>
<H2>-t ttylist      Select by tty.</H2><PRE>
                This selects the processes associated with the terminals given
                in <I>ttylist</I>. Terminals (ttys, or screens for text output) can
                be specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1. A plain
                "-" may be used to select processes not attached to any
                terminal.



</PRE>
<H2>-u userlist     Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.</H2><PRE>
                This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is
                in <I>userlist</I>. The effective user ID describes the user whose
                file access permissions are used by the process
                (see <B>geteuid(2)</B>). Identical to <B>U</B> and <B>--user</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>--Group grplist Select by real group ID (RGID) or name. Identical to -G.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>--User userlist Select by real user ID (RUID) or name. Identical to -U.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>--group grplist Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.</H2><PRE>
                This selects the processes whose effective group name or ID is
                in <I>grouplist</I>. The effective group ID describes the group whose
                file access permissions are used by the process
                (see <B>geteuid(2)</B>). The <B>-g</B> option is often an alternative
                to <B>--group</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>--pid pidlist   Select by process ID. Identical to -p and p.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>--ppid pidlist  Select by parent process ID. This selects the processes with a</H2><PRE>
                parent process ID in pidlist. That is, it selects processes
                that are children of those listed in pidlist.



</PRE>
<H2>--sid sesslist  Select by session ID. Identical to -s.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>--tty ttylist   Select by terminal. Identical to -t and t.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>--user userlist Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name. Identical to -u</H2><PRE>
                and <B>U</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>-123            Identical to --sid 123.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>123             Identical to --pid 123.</H2><PRE>




</PRE>
<H2>OUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>These options are used to choose the information displayed by ps. The output</H2><PRE>
may differ by personality.




</PRE>
<H2>-F              extra full format. See the -f option, which -F implies.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-O format       is like -o, but preloaded with some default columns. Identical</H2><PRE>
                to <B>-o</B> <B>pid,</B><I>format</I><B>,state,tname,time,command</B> or
                <B>-o</B> <B>pid,</B><I>format</I><B>,tname,time,cmd</B>, see <B>-o</B> below.



</PRE>
<H2>O format        is preloaded o (overloaded).</H2><PRE>
                The BSD <B>O</B> option can act like <B>-O</B> (user-defined output format
                with some common fields predefined) or can be used to specify
                sort order. Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of
                this option. To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
                (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way
                (e.g. with <B>-O</B> or <B>--sort</B>). When used as a formatting option, it
                is identical to <B>-O</B>, with the BSD personality.



</PRE>
<H2>-M              Add a column of security data. Identical to Z. (for SE Linux)</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>X               Register format.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>Z               Add a column of security data. Identical to -M. (for SE Linux)</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-c              Show different scheduler information for the -l option.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-f              does full-format listing. This option can be combined with</H2><PRE>
                many other UNIX-style options to add additional columns. It
                also causes the command arguments to be printed. When used
                with <B>-L</B>, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID)
                columns will be added. See the <B>c</B> option, the format keyword
                <B>args</B>, and the format keyword <B>comm</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>j               BSD job control format.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-j              jobs format</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>l               display BSD long format.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-l              long format. The -y option is often useful with this.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>o format        specify user-defined format. Identical to -o and --format.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-o format       user-defined format.</H2><PRE>
                <I>format</I> is a single argument in the form of a blank-separated
                or comma-separated list, which offers a way to specify
                individual output columns. The recognized keywords are
                described in the <B>STANDARD</B> <B>FORMAT</B> <B>SPECIFIERS</B> section below.
                Headers may be renamed
                (<B>ps</B> <B>-o</B> <B>pid,ruser=RealUser</B> <B>-o</B> <B>comm=Command</B>) as desired. If all
                column headers are empty (<B>ps</B> <B>-o</B> <B>pid=</B> <B>-o</B> <B>comm=</B>) then the header
                line will not be output. Column width will increase as needed
                for wide headers; this may be used to widen up columns such as
                WCHAN (<B>ps</B> <B>-o</B> <B>pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN</B> <B>-o</B> <B>comm</B>). Explicit
                width control (<B>ps</B> <B>opid,wchan:42,cmd</B>) is offered too. The
                behavior of <B>ps</B> <B>-o</B> <B>pid=X,comm=Y</B> varies with personality; output
                may be one column named "X,comm=Y" or two columns named "X"
                and "Y". Use multiple <B>-o</B> options when in doubt. Use the
                <B>PS_FORMAT</B> environment variable to specify a default as
                desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to
                choose the default UNIX or BSD columns.



</PRE>
<H2>s               display signal format</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>u               display user-oriented format</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>v               display virtual memory format</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>-y              Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr. This option can</H2><PRE>
                only be used with <B>-l</B>.



</PRE>
<H2>-Z              display security context format (SELinux, etc.)</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>--format format user-defined format. Identical to -o and o.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>--context       Display security context format. (for SE Linux)</H2><PRE>




</PRE>
<H2>OUTPUT MODIFIERS</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>-H              show process hierarchy (forest)</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>N namelist      Specify namelist file. Identical to -n, see -n above.</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>O order         Sorting order. (overloaded)</H2><PRE>
                The BSD <B>O</B> option can act like <B>-O</B> (user-defined output format
                with some common fields predefined) or can be used to specify
                sort order. Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of
                this option. To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
                (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way
                (e.g. with <B>-O</B> or <B>--sort</B>).

                For sorting, obsolete BSD <B>O</B> option syntax is
                <B>O</B>[<B>+</B>|<B>-</B>]<I>k1</I>[,[<B>+</B>|<B>-</B>]<I>k2</I>[,...]]. It orders the processes listing
                according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence of
                one-letter short keys <I>k1</I>, <I>k2</I>, ... described in the <B>OBSOLETE</B>
                <B>SORT</B> <B>KEYS</B> section below. The "+" is currently optional, merely
                re-iterating the default direction on a key, but may help to
                distinguish an <B>O</B> sort from an <B>O</B> format. The "-" reverses
                direction only on the key it precedes.



</PRE>
<H2>S               Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child</H2><PRE>
                processes into their parent. This is useful for examining a
                system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived
                children to do work.



</PRE>
<H2>c               Show the true command name. This is derived from the name of</H2><PRE>
                the executable file, rather than from the argv value. Command
                arguments and any modifications to them (see <B>setproctitle(3)</B>)
                are thus not shown. This option effectively turns the <B>args</B>
                format keyword into the <B>comm</B> format keyword; it is useful with
                the <B>-f</B> format option and with the various BSD-style format
                options, which all normally display the command arguments. See
                the <B>-f</B> option, the format keyword <B>args</B>, and the format keyword

                The <B>h</B> option is problematic. Standard BSD <B>ps</B> uses this option
                to print a header on each page of output, but older Linux <B>ps</B>
                uses this option to totally disable the header. This version
                of <B>ps</B> follows the Linux usage of not printing the header
                unless the BSD personality has been selected, in which case it
                prints a header on each page of output. Regardless of the
                current personality, you can use the long options <B>--headers</B>
                and <B>--no-headers</B> to enable printing headers each page or
                disable headers entirely, respectively.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>This ps works by reading the virtual files in /proc. This ps does not need to</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run. Do not give this ps any special</H2><PRE>
permissions.


</PRE>
<H2>This ps needs access to namelist data for proper WCHAN display. For kernels</H2><PRE>
prior to 2.6, the System.map file must be installed.

CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running
during the entire lifetime of a process. This is not ideal, and it does not

</PRE>
<H2>conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to. CPU usage is unlikely</H2><PRE>
to add up to exactly 100%.

The SIZE and RSS fields don’t count some parts of a process including the page
tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct task_struct. This is
usually at least 20 KiB of memory that is always resident. SIZE is the virtual
size of the process (code+data+stack).

Processes marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes (so-called "zombies") that
remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly. These processes
will be destroyed by <B>init(8)</B> if the parent process exits.




</PRE>
<H2>PROCESS FLAGS</H2><PRE>
The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is provided by

</PRE>
<H2>the flags output specifier.</H2><PRE>
1    forked but didn’t exec
4    used super-user privileges



</PRE>
<H2>PROCESS STATE CODES</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers</H2><PRE>
(header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process.
D    Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R    Running or runnable (on run queue)
S    Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T    Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.
W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
X    dead (should never be seen)
Z    Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.


</PRE>
<H2>For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may</H2><PRE>
be displayed:
<    high-priority (not nice to other users)
N    low-priority (nice to other users)
L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
s    is a session leader
l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
+    is in the foreground process group




</PRE>
<H2>OBSOLETE SORT KEYS</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>These keys are used by the BSD O option (when it is used for sorting). The GNU</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>--sort option doesn’t use these keys, but the specifiers described below in</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section. Note that the values used in sorting</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>are the internal values ps uses and not the "cooked" values used in some of</H2><PRE>
the output format fields (e.g. sorting on tty will sort into device number,

</PRE>
<H2>not according to the terminal name displayed). Pipe ps output into the sort(1)</H2><PRE>
command if you want to sort the cooked values.

<H2>AIX FORMAT DESCRIPTORS</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>This ps supports AIX format descriptors, which work somewhat like the</H2><PRE>
formatting codes of <B>printf(1)</B> and <B>printf(3)</B>. For example, the normal default

</PRE>
<H2>output can be produced with this:  ps -eo "%p %y %x %c". The NORMAL codes are</H2><PRE>
described in the next section.


</PRE>
<H2>CODE   NORMAL   HEADER</H2><PRE>
%C     pcpu     %CPU

</PRE>
<H2>STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS</H2><PRE>
Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output format

</PRE>
<H2>(e.g. with option -o) or to sort the selected processes with the GNU-style</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>--sort option.</H2><PRE>


</PRE>
<H2>For example:  ps -eo pid,user,args --sort user</H2><PRE>


</PRE>
<H2>This version of ps tries to recognize most of the keywords used in other</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>implementations of ps.</H2><PRE>


</PRE>
<H2>The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces: args, cmd,</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>comm, command, fname, ucmd, ucomm, lstart, bsdstart, start.</H2><PRE>

Some keywords may not be available for sorting.



</PRE>
<H2>CODE       HEADER   DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>


</PRE>
<H2>%cpu       %CPU     cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.</H2><PRE>
                    Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the time the
                    process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio),
                    expressed as a percentage. It will not add up to 100%
                    unless you are lucky. (alias <B>pcpu</B>).


</PRE>
<H2>%mem       %MEM     ratio of the process’s resident set size  to the physical</H2><PRE>
                    memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.
                    (alias <B>pmem</B>).


</PRE>
<H2>args       COMMAND  command with all its arguments as a string. Modifications</H2><PRE>
                    to the arguments may be shown. The output in this column
                    may contain spaces. A process marked &lt;defunct&gt; is partly
                    dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.
                    Sometimes the process args will be unavailable; when this
                    happens, <B>ps</B> will instead print the executable name in
                    brackets. (alias <B>cmd</B>, <B>command</B>). See also the <B>comm</B> format
                    keyword, the <B>-f</B> option, and the <B>c</B> option.
                    When specified last, this column will extend to the edge
                    of the display. If <B>ps</B> can not determine display width, as
                    when output is redirected (piped) into a file or another
                    command, the output width is undefined. (it may be 80,
                    unlimited, determined by the <B>TERM</B> variable, and so on) The
                    <B>COLUMNS</B> environment variable or <B>--cols</B> option may be used
                    to exactly determine the width in this case. The <B>w</B> or <B>-w</B>
                    option may be also be used to adjust width.

                    is "mmm dd" (where mmm is the three letters of the month).


</PRE>
<H2>bsdtime    TIME     accumulated cpu time, user + system. The display format is</H2><PRE>
                    usualy "MMM:SS", but can be shifted to the right if the

</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>The following environment variables could affect ps:</H2><PRE>


</PRE>
<H2>COLUMNS</H2><PRE>
   Override default display width.


</PRE>
<H2>LINES</H2><PRE>
   Override default display height.


</PRE>
<H2>PS_PERSONALITY</H2><PRE>
   Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital...
   (see section <B>PERSONALITY</B> below).


</PRE>
<H2>CMD_ENV</H2><PRE>
   Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital...
   (see section <B>PERSONALITY</B> below).


</PRE>
<H2>I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS</H2><PRE>
   Force obsolete command line interpretation.


</PRE>
<H2>LC_TIME</H2><PRE>
   Date format.


</PRE>
<H2>PS_COLORS</H2><PRE>
   Not currently supported.


</PRE>
<H2>PS_FORMAT</H2><PRE>
   Default output format override. You may set this to a format string of the
   type used for the <B>-o</B> option. The <B>DefSysV</B> and <B>DefBSD</B> values are particularly
   useful.


</PRE>
<H2>PS_SYSMAP</H2><PRE>
   Default namelist (System.map) location.


</PRE>
<H2>PS_SYSTEM_MAP</H2><PRE>
   Default namelist (System.map) location.


</PRE>
<H2>POSIXLY_CORRECT</H2><PRE>
   Don’t find excuses to ignore bad "features".


</PRE>
<H2>POSIX2</H2><PRE>
   When set to "on", acts as <B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>UNIX95</H2><PRE>
   Don’t find excuses to ignore bad "features".


</PRE>
<H2>_XPG</H2><PRE>
   Cancel <B>CMD_ENV</B><I>=irix</I> non-standard behavior.

In general, it is a bad idea to set these variables. The one exception is

</PRE>
<H2>CMD_ENV or PS_PERSONALITY, which could be set to Linux for normal systems.</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>Without that setting, ps follows the useless and bad parts of the Unix98</H2><PRE>
standard.

<H2>AUTHOR</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>ps was originally written by Branko Lankester <lankeste@fwi.uva.nl>. Michael</H2><PRE>
K. Johnson &lt;johnsonm@redhat.com&gt; re-wrote it significantly to use the proc
filesystem, changing a few things in the process. Michael Shields
<mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu&gt; added the pid-list feature. Charles Blake
<cblake@bbn.com&gt; added multi-level sorting, the dirent-style library, the
device name-to-number mmaped database, the approximate binary search directly
on System.map, and many code and documentation cleanups. David Mossberger-Tang
wrote the generic BFD support for psupdate. Albert Cahalan
<albert@users.sf.net&gt; rewrote ps for full Unix98 and BSD support, along with
some ugly hacks for obsolete and foreign syntax.
