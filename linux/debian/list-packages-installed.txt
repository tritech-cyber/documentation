List all installed packages
With version and architecture information, and description, in a table:

dpkg-query -l
Package names only, one per line:

dpkg-query -f '${binary:Package}\n' -W
List packages using a search pattern
It is possible to add a search pattern to list packages:


dpkg-query -l 'foo*'
Show status of all packages on the system
To check the status of all packages on your system:


dpkg-query -l '*' | less
This will show all packages (one line each) that are in various stages of installation (including packages that were removed but not purged) and packages just available from a repository. To show only installed packages:


dpkg -l | grep '^.i'
